# Event Catcher Chrome Extension
Created a chrome extension using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can enlist the websites visited by the user.
Consists of 3 operations namely Save (current) tab, Save (any required URL), and Delete All listed URLs at once
Used the addEventListener command for operating the first 2 buttons on single click and Delete All button on double click
Stores the enlisted URLs in Local Storage of Google Chrome as long until Delete All button is used or Window is closed
Used CSS for styling of the extension and created a manifest.json file to deploy the extension as a pack in Chrome
